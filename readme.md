
# Vausly Portfolio Page

This page is an HTML version of my [web profile](https://github.com/Vausly/web-profile) repo so that it can connect to the page created on Cloudflare Pages. Why am I doing this? Because if I put it on username.github.io, the path from other repositories will conflict (such as /repository-example, etc.), while I want the static HTML code to remain on GitHub Pages. 

Domain that I want to use on GitHub pages for all repository: https://www.vausly.my.id/

My portfolio page can be found here: https://web.vausly.my.id/

My React web profile repo: https://git.new/wp-repo

BTW, if you like my project, make sure you support us by donate: https://u.vausly.com/tip
